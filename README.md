# TODO:  

 Get game processes and Swing up and running. We'll need to also need to make the documentation of the classes and methods without documentation. ~~I'll be creating icons to use for the pieces this week, and if I need to, a board.~~ Images are uploaded.
 
 Any missing information in the Chess and ChessGame classes needs to be filled in. ~~I(Kika) have a little more work to do on the added Piece abstract method getMoveSpan() for Knight, rook, Queen, and King.~~


 Could we please code in an IDE instead of on GitHub from now on? I (David) spent like 2 hours just fixing a bunch of syntax errors. I witnessed so many gruesome errors that I think I got PTSD :P.
 BTW, while fixing these errors I might have changed the intended behavior so check and fix.
 
 And, could we also make method names more clear? For example, the method name impededCheck() returns a boolean but its  ambiguous to what it actually returns. And the method notSameColor() gives a negative boolean which is hard to understand. That's why i change the names
 
 And Danny, could you do stuff?
