1- Update Documentation, utilize the coorodinate class.

~~Utilize the Location and Piece objects I have provided in the skeletons of the methods. getNum() and getLetter() are implemented in both Location and Piece, and getLocAt() will get the Location object at the given coordinates. 
Location.procCoords() returns the String notation of what the notation is (letter)(number).The double array coordinate system is(letter)(number)(letter), with 0-7 being the direction of white on the "number" axis which will graphically be the y axis, and 7-0 the direction of black on the "letter" axis which will graphically be the x axis.~~

 UPDATE: ALL testMove methods are done, and I have added an abstract impededCheck method to the Piece class. The testMove method should utilize this method as a helper method to check if the path to the move is clear, if not, it will return false. The code has yet to be tested, and needs to be.

Please note that the instance of Check will be tested seprately, so you do not need to worry about that. You only need to test on whether the piece can reach its destination without impedence.
