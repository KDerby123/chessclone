# UPDATE:  

TODO: testMove() methods of Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King classes. This method will check if the move inputed is a valid move.
Utilize the Location and Piece objects I have provided in the skeletons of the methods. getX() and getY() are implemented in both Location and Piece, and getLocAt() will get the Location object at the given coordinates.

UPDATE: King and Pawn's testMove methods are done, and I have added an abstract impededCheck method to the Piece class. This method should be used in conjunction with the testMove method and should check if the path to the move is clear, if not, it will return false.
