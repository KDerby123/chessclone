# TODO:  

 Get game processes and Swing up and running. We'll need to also need to make the documentation of the classes and methods without documentation. I'll be creating icons to use for the pieces this week, and if I need to, a board.
 
 Any missing information in the Chess and ChessGame classes needs to be filled in. I(Kika) have a little more work to do on the added Piece abstract method getMoveSpan() for Knight, rook, Queen, and King.
