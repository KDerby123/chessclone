# UPDATE:  

TODO: testMove() methods of Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King classes. This method will check if the move inputed is a valid move.
Utilize the Location and Piece objects I have provided in the skeletons of the methods. getX() and getY() are implemented in both Location and Piece, and getLocAt() will get the Location object at the given coordinates.
